I believe, that the Hive ecosphere has big advantages and is especially appropriate to help people in need. So I try to invent a system, that has trustworthy curators, trustworthy authors and donators who finance the helpers in an efficient way.\n\n\n## The Rules + The Criteria\nThe curators look for posts, that contain:\n- Good written content from people helping other people or the environment\n- Pictures, to proof that this post is real and not spam or fake.\n- Not too low reputation score of the authors.\n- ...\n\nAnyone can be a curator. If you find posts, which match the criteria, mark it with a \"!CHARY\" in the comments. You can add a colon + a number from zero to ten, to weight this post. Example:\n\n!CHARY:7\n\nThis is no garanty that the author gets rewarded, but it appears in the results, which @anobel checks. Don't abuse this, or you will get listed on a blacklist.\n\nA weekly report consolidates these posts and orders the winners (by rules, that the @achimmertens/@anobel defines).\nAll the Hive-money, that has been send until then to @anobel, will be distributed among the winners.\n\nThe SQL-code to find the posts is:\n```\n-- Suche die Posts, die exakt \"!CHARY\" beinhalten (egal ob im Hauptpost oder in den Kommentaren)\n-- und sortiere sie nach Zeit\nSELECT \n\tauthor, root_title, last_update, url, body, total_vote_weight\nFROM \n   Comments \nWHERE CONTAINS(body, '\"!CHARY\"')\n   AND body LIKE '%!CHARY%' COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS\nORDER BY last_update DESC;\n```\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/anobel/23vsmbzaM8PtfucVYFSj5gtesXtWAG7YkhtXvUDXQARn9A4DXULKTLimnMvdWnZDnXxgg.png)\n*Workflow of the Nobelprize system*\n\n# What you can do\nIf you want to support needy people and their helpers also, you can:\n\n## Reblog this report\nThe more people are involved, the more we can reach. \n\n## Curation Trail\nFollow @anobel in the curation trail: \nhttps://hive.vote/dash.php\n\nThere you upvote automatically everyone, who @anobel will upvote. With this, you give some upvotes to the people that do good things:\n\n\n## Donate Hive to @anobel \nAll the Hive money that anobel owns, will be distributed among the next winners. This promise can be proved by checking [@anobel's wallet](https://peakd.com/@anobel/wallet).\n\n## Help other people and write about it\nDo something good and talk about it. Write it honestly and don't be ashamed to talk about your help. Use the hashtag \"charity\" and post it in the community [\"Charity\"](https://peakd.com/c/hive-149312). \n\n## Subscribe to [\"Charity\"](https://peakd.com/c/hive-149312) and engage with others\nSubscribe to this community, curate some content and talk to the authors to engage them. It is very important, that bloggers get feedback. It motivates them to go on. In return you get new friends and an overwiew, what good things happens in this world. It is a big contrast to the rest of the news.\n\n\n## Follow [@anobel](https://peakd.com/@anobel)\nThere you should get regularely reports about the winners. This is at the moment under construction. The reports are generated manually at the moment, but I (@achimmertens) am working on that.\n\n## Follow [@achimmertens](https://peakd.com/@achimmertens)\nYes, I am always happy, when someone reads and upvote my work ;-)\n\n---\n\nSee you with the next \"Hive Nobel Prizes Rewards\" Report,\n\nGreeting, Anobel (alias Achim)","total_vote_weight":1223538551899,"charyNumber":7,"account":"anobel","weburl":"https://peakd.com/hive-149312/@anobel/hive-nobel-prize-rewards-for-week-33-20-hive-3-winners"},{"author":"achimmertens","root_title":"My Cleanplanet activity 22/8/2023","last_update":"2023-08-23T05:08:21.000Z","url":"/hive-150210/@idikachisom/my-cleanplanet-activity-22-8-2023#@achimmertens/re-idikachisom-rztvly","body":"Thank you for cleaning your environment!\n!CHARY:3","total_vote_weight":0,"charyNumber":3,"account":"idikachisom","weburl":"https://peakd.com/hive-150210/@idikachisom/my-cleanplanet-activity-22-8-2023"},{"author":"achimmertens","root_title":"My cleaning activities","last_update":"2023-08-18T10:28:42.000Z","url":"/hive-150210/@mr-chuks/my-cleaning-activities#@achimmertens/re-mr-chuks-rzl13v","body":"Hi @mr-chuks,\n\nyou have been chosen by @anobel to get some small reward.
