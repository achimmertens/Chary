I am proud to announce, that I can send some money to people, which helped other people in recent days.

# Here are the winners of the last week:

The first place goes to @ayomiku this week. She describes the hard work in the rice fields. It is a community that helps each other. I think it is a good example how small communities should work (without money).
The two second places go to two persons, that keep on cleening the planet. As you may know, I like these small things, because they are the keynotes to make a better world.

# Asking for Support

At the moment I check here and there the Hive posts to find some posts from people, that are worthy to get a small goodie. But I don't have so much time and I would like to ask you to search also for this kind of good content.
If you find a post, that is worthy for a "Nobel Prize", please mark it with "!CHARY".
If you have questions, please ask me or @achimmertens



Greeting, Anobel (alias Achim)
