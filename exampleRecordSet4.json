We rebuilt, as much as possible, into an agile team and I became its product owner.\nIn 2021 I attended a Developer Academy for 6 months and now I am a Software Engineer.\n\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/23tHbkj8AudnyW9rkYq4eFGFDGKoSE2ux43rX2W92LoDTSgdiLJ3a7SQeeiGnkVJny5r9.png)\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/23tHbkj8AudnbM2GwdybS1ZXAwMsNq897LyZ5LwRvcJJKPMfhmcQDLNVfp1LVaJCg2sTN.png)\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/23tHb6kpgHrwViVFUHgrxjQ4ispQMnNzfyFdBGNUDhehE7s8ZXb9pSuGXknbvXiFrzWcx.png)\n\nMy Trainings:\n\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/Eo2BJ5b2aWXJCwT91n223rxid2PfwogXgpa3xGWU68vxK1REghLDLEeP9fKDSSznrzZ.png)\n\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/Eo4Jqsn8EHVVYPMiCYrQUG7MBTwqcF95H3tXXKdssotpEVwacuzXNHXhKRCNhDWiKwv.png)\n\n\n*(Taken from my [LinkeIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/achim-mertens-97b0b1291/details/experience/))*\n\n\n\n## My Private Projects\nI have a few hobbies that fit very well with my professional interests:\n\n### Token statistics evaluation and sales in the Hive blockchain:\nI read data from an API interface on the Hive blockchain via bash scripts that I run daily using crontab. These are stored in my Elasticsearch database, which runs inside a Docker container on my Raspberry Pi. Kibana turns them into graphics, which I store locally as images using Selenide JavaScript. Another JavaScript pumps these images via API to backblaze.com and I get back the URLs of each. I paste these, as well as tables from Elasticsearch, into report templates and upload them to the Hive blockchain, where I receive a small reward for doing so. You can see the results here: https://peakd.com/@achimmertens?filter=stats\n\n### Donation System On The Hive Blockchain:\nPosts that are about helping people, I (or other curators) mark with a \"!CHARY\" in the replies. An SQL query running in my JavaScript searches the blockchain for these tagged posts. This gives me a table that sorts the authors and their articles according to certain criteria. Rank 1-3 receive a small contribution of donations from a pot. The results are summarized in a report: https://peakd.com/@anobel\n\n# My Hobbies\n## Family And Friends\nI spend a lot of time with my family and friends. We play board games, go hiking or just chat.\nMy wife and I have bought a [vacation home in Einruhr/Eifel](https://einruhr.wordpress.com/) and spend a few days off there.\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/23x12smg6jq6k3VnFFAaRahcJ923tEvghA6ipNJQ9nDfNSmD3BodsPHmeXEGQ9dB61bbh.png)\n\n\n## House And Forest\nOf course, a lot of time goes into keeping our actual house and garden in order. Our house is CO2 neutral and besides solar thermal and photovoltaic, we heat our water-bearing stove with wood in winter. This must be prepared for it. By good luck, I could acquire a small forest in our area a few years ago. There I cut 1-2 trees per year and process them into firewood.\n\n## Further Hobbies\n- Our Church\nWe go regularely to our church and are a bit involved in their actions\n- Comics\nI like to draw sketchnotes and comics. Here is my book that I wrote: \"Greensniper\" [ebook](https://www.bod.de/buchshop/greensniper-ein-ritter-der-auszog-die-welt-zu-retten-achim-mertens-9783755780878) or [paperbook](https://www.bod.de/buchshop/greensniper-achim-mertens-9783756228935)\n- Sword Fighting\nSometimes, for example, at community celebrations, I put on my knight costume and fight against children and adults.\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/23xer1uxxuFKHE2bCvPDbG8PxMm9WHWaUat2vK488rdhGe5MPr4HkTf6Kn37msf6cDocT.jpg)\n- Chicken\nWe have a few chickens in our garden, they want to be taken care of.\n- Archery\nSometimes I go to a parkour with like-minded people and practice archery.\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/EoeEVADjFjYcCNagCs977ACSZXGhQEBMZ25QK2BUuUdWPyfCR5eJhDbrjZcGhNvLqsu.jpg)\n- Reading\nI like to read non-fiction and novels with depth\n\n\n# My Mottos\n## Create More Than You Consume\nI currently live in a world that gives me a lot of freedom. I have no essential worries. I am aware of how fragile that is. The basis for this is that, in addition to health, peace and prosperity, we also have an intact nature. This is visibly and increasingly threatened. I know about my resource consumption and try to keep it low. Through my work at Deutsche Telekom, I can contribute my share to prosperity. In my view, the relationship between taking and giving must be such, that in the end society benefits from my presence and not vice versa.\n\n## The wise man eats wholemeal bread\nSugar is delicious. It directly triggers feelings of happiness (dopamine) . The trick is, since these kicks are available everywhere, not to access them permanently. This is also true for other \"happiness boosters\" such as TicToc videos or \"cheap wisdom\" (fake news). \nBrown bread and vegetables have many ballast substances (fiber). These provide utilization of the intestinal flora, better digestion and serotonin output, a hormone that makes satisfaction.\nThe wise man invests not only in his digestion but also in his spiritual and other consumption. Scientific information may be a little harder to digest, but it brings more happiness in the long run.\n\n## Believe is not Knowledge\nThe difference between faith and knowledge can be deadly. A group of refugees in a war zone has a higher chance of survival if they not only believe, but know where the enemy is.\nIn our daily lives, we are heavily influenced by the media, all of which claim to tell \"the truth. But even if \"the truth\" is true, it always refers to only one aspect.\nWe live in a very complex world. There are many truths, some of them seemingly contradictory.\nKnowledge means it is verifiable. Again and again. Our civilization is built on scientific and engineering knowledge.\nI have a problem with people who sweep that away and point to social media news that offers a simple but false explanation.\nOur minds are full of fallacies. We should be more careful about bragging about our \"knowledge\" and admit more often that we are only believing something here.\n\n## CEN (Control, Influence, Nothingness)\nThere is a lot wrong in this world. It hurts me to watch and do nothing about it.\nBut I also had to learn painfully that sometimes it's just the way it is and that in my small position I can't change it. Then getting angry doesn't help either.\nI divide my sphere of influence into 3 categories and corresponding allowed emotions:\n1. I have control and can change it directly.\n-> I am allowed to get angry.\n2. I can influence the result only indirectly.\n-> I should reduce my anger to the extent that I can influence it. \n3. I cannot do anything about it.\n-> Looking away and escapism is allowed or even desired.\nThe thing with emotions is of course theory, but you can already learn what you are upset about.\nFor some issues, actionism doesn't bring anything directly, but it influences others. (E.g., not flying to a vacation destination. That doesn't save a single tree or polar bear, but it does change our culture).\n\n# My Political Opinions\nAnyone who has read this far might think that I am left-green (filthy). But I don't want to commit myself to any party. The Greens do a lot wrong, which I do not support. But other parties are often no better.\nCapitalism has many disadvantages (externalization, colonization, abuse of power,...) but also many advantages (rewarding the industrious, prosperity,...).\nI am a friend of democracy and I want the conditions for it to be preserved. For this, I also go to demonstrate (without violence).\nOur human-made Climate change is our greatest threat.\n\n![grafik.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/23tmFdvSvhgYV8d6TQ86xFuJyceQ8o5SsrYgPU8zVkR82tZxN1rpufpnQ228BAquNi7kL.png)\n\n\n# Conclusion\nI have a lot of interests and am always \"busy\". This makes me an \"allrounder\" with more \"horizontal\" in the \"T-Shape\". \nI get along well with most people as long as they are authentic and not too self-centered.\n\nMore details about me: [Greensniper](https://greensniper.wordpress.com)\n\nRegards, Achim\n\n\n","total_vote_weight":0,"charyNumber":null,"account":"achimmertens","weburl":"https://peakd.com/hive-155221/@achimmertens/my-profile-introduceyourself"},{"author":"achimmertens","root_title":"News about our fundraiser for Uganda! - Neuigkeiten unserer Spendenaktion für Uganda!
